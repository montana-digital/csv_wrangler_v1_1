# Minimal dependencies for CSV Wrangler
# Core packages required for basic functionality
# Install this if you want the smallest package size possible

streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.1.0
sqlalchemy>=2.0.23

# Note: Without optional packages, the following features will have limited functionality:
# - Visualizations: Not available (requires plotly)
# - CSV reading: Uses standard pandas engine (slower for large files without pyarrow)
# - Date parsing: Uses built-in datetime (fewer date formats supported without dateutil)
